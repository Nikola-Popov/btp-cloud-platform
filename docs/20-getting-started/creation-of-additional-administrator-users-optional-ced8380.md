# Creation of Additional Administrator Users \(Optional\)

After you have set up the ABAP environment for administration, add more administrator users for the ABAP environment.

After you have completed the administrative setup, only your user is available as administrator in the ABAP environment. You will probably want to create more administration users for your ABAP environment. Creating more administration users also helps you verify that your administrative setup is correct and complete.
