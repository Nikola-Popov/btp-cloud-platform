# About the Trial Account

A trial account lets you try out the Kyma environment for free with a restricted use of the platform resources and services. Access is open to everyone. Trial accounts are intended for personal exploration, and not for production use or team development.

## Trial Period

The trial account is valid for 90 days. During this time, you can explore and use the basic functionality of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime for 14 days. After 90 days, your account is automatically deleted, and you’ll no longer be able to access your data. See [Trial Accounts and Free Tier](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform-internal/trial-accounts-and-free-tier?locale=en-US&state=DRAFT&version=Internal#trial-lifecycle) to learn more about the trial periods.

Note that while your trial account is valid for 90 days, the Kyma environment that you create with it expires **14 days** after its creation and is then deleted permanently. To create a new Kyma environment, you must first disable the expired Kyma on your subaccount. To learn how to do that, see [Disable Expired Trial Kyma Environment](setting-up-your-trial-account-57074a0.md#loiod022bb1dde7d499685ee6ef3ab825680).

> ### Caution:  
> Once your account has expired, your cluster is deleted and all the cluster resources are removed. We recommend that you back up your cluster configuration to restore it quickly if you choose to create a new Kyma environment.

## Scope and Limitations

-   It's possible to provision only one Kyma environment per global account.
-   You can manage members in your trial account.
-   Kyma trial accounts are available in all SAP BTP regions.
-   A trial account provides you with a 1-node cluster with 4 vCPU and 16 GB of memory. An idle cluster without any customer workload uses around 33% of vCPU and 33% of memory.
-   A trial account comes with a cluster with built-in eventing.
-   Events are processed in-memory and are not persisted to disk. Not delivered events will be lost on restart of the eventing infrastructure.
-   There’s no service level agreement with regards to the availability of the platform.
