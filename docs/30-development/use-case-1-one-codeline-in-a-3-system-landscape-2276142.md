# Use Case 1: One Codeline in a 3-System Landscape

You can apply this setup if you have occasional development activities for larger applications where testing needs to run in parallel to development or should take place in a non-development system to ensure the solution also runs in a non-development system. In this setup, you either need to be able to pause development for a fix that has to be delivered before the next release or you have to deliver fixes as part of the next possible release.

This landscape consists of a development, quality assurance, and production system.

## For Go Live/Development After Go Live \(Including Deferrable Corrections\)

**Starting situation for Go Live**

The Go Live process is characterized by creating different systems only when needed for the first time, however, you can provision the systems already beforehand. Furthermore, the software component of a planned solution does not exist from the beginning. The resulting release branch is YYYY-01. Apart from this, the Go Live process does not differ from the release development processes afterwards.

**Starting situation after Go Live**

-   Development system DEV is based on the main branch
-   Quality Assurance system QAS and production system PRD are based on the latest release branch YYYY-<nn\>. In case of a first release after the Go Live, YYYY-<nn\> is YYYY-01


System QAS has always the same software state as the PRD system, unless a new change is tested and released. This means, transport requests are released in development ABAP systems only if development is completed and it is planned to import the changes to the production system.

This process can also be used for deferrable corrections, which do not need to reach production before the next development release. These corrections are handled like regular development.

## Urgent Corrections

-   Development system DEV is based on the main branch
-   Quality assurance system QAS and production system PRD are based on the latest release branch YYYY-<nn\>. In case of a correction after the Go Live before the second release, YYYY-<nn\> is YYYY-01

This process differs from the previous one in the branch it is developed in. As the correction is too urgent to release it with the next development release only, it is done in the release branch. To achieve this separation, all current development activities need to be paused because the DEV system needs to check out the latest release branch instead of the main branch. That means all open transports in DEV need to be released first to save the work in progress to the main branch, so that feature development can be resumed later after the correction.
