# Scoping Space and Page Templates

The scoping of space and page templates refers to the process of defining the visibility or accessibility of these objects.

Space and page templates are not visible in the [Manage Launchpad Spaces](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/user-interface-configurations/manage-launchpad-spaces?version=Cloud) and [Manage Launchpad Pages](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/user-interface-configurations/manage-launchpad-pages?version=Cloud) apps by default. Meaning, they cannot be assigned or used within a business role. The space and page templates need to be scoped.

To use the space and page templates you must implement your own scoping. When testing locally, e.g., in a development system, it is recommended to use a console application to set the space and page template in scope. To set the space and page templates in scope in a test or production system, it is recommended to use [Application Jobs](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/application-jobs-3?version=Cloud). In both implementations, the class must call the scoping API \(application programming interface\) `CL_APS_BC_SCOPE_CHANGE_API`.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> 
>     CONSTANTS obj_name_page  TYPE c LENGTH 40 VALUE 'PAGE' ##NO_TEXT.
>     CONSTANTS obj_name_space TYPE c LENGTH 40 VALUE 'SPACE' ##NO_TEXT.
> 
>     DATA(lo_scope_api) = cl_aps_bc_scope_change_api=>create_instance( ).
> 
>     lo_scope_api->scope(
>       EXPORTING it_object_scope  = VALUE #(
>           pgmid       = if_aps_bc_scope_change_api=>gc_tadir_pgmid-R3TR
>           scope_state = if_aps_bc_scope_change_api=>gc_scope_state-ON
>           ( object = if_aps_bc_scope_change_api=>gc_tadir_object-UIST obj_name = obj_name_space )
>           ( object = if_aps_bc_scope_change_api=>gc_tadir_object-UIPG obj_name = obj_name_page ) )
>                 iv_simulate      = abap_false
>                 iv_force         = abap_false
>       IMPORTING et_object_result = DATA(lt_results)
>                 et_message       = DATA(lt_messages) ).
> 
>     LOOP AT lt_results INTO DATA(ls_result).
>        ...
>     ENDLOOP.
> 
> ```

> ### Restriction:  
> Creation of Space Templates and Page Templates
> 
> -   There is no ABAP Git integration for space and page templates.
> 
> -   The development process is described in detail in the [UI Development guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/abap-environment/ui-development-overview).
> 
>     -   Space templates can be assigned to business roles in the Maintain Business Roles app. The assignment to business role templates in ADT is not possible.
> 
>     -   Space templates canâ€™t be merged with other space templates directly. To merge a space template with another space template, one of the templates must be copied to create a space first.
> 
>         When you want to merge one or more customer-created spaces with a predefined space \(e.g. delivered by SAP\) or a template, open the general details for the customer-created space, then enter the space ID of the predefined space or template in the field *Merge ID*. The same is true for the merging of page templates.
> 
>     -   To be able to access space and templates in the Manage Launchpad Spaces and Manage Launchpad Pages apps, these need to be set in scope programmatically.
