# Multiple Buildpack Framework

The Multiple Buildpack Framework enables SAP Java Buildpack to act as the final buildpack in a multiple buildpack deployment. It reads the contributions of other, earlier buildpacks and incorporates them into its standard staging.

> ### Note:  
> If you try to use SAP Java Buildpack as a non-final buildpack, an error will be thrown.

When SAP Java Buildpack acts as the final buildpack in a multiple buildpack deployment, it honors the following core contract integration points with non-final buildpacks:
