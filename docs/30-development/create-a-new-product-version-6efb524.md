# Create a New Product Version

The *Build Product Version* app lets you create new product versions from scratch in case of new releases or based on parent ones if you are creating a patch delivery or support package stack.

> ### Note:  
> You need to have configured the templates for a product to create new product versions using this app. See [Configure a Pipeline Template](configure-a-pipeline-template-dac47ae.md).

Find out how to create a new product version:

1.  Log in to the *Landscape Portal* and click on the tile *Build Product Version*.

2.  Select one of your products from the list. You will be forwarded to the *Product Versions* tab. Here, you can see a table listing all the existing versions of this product, their type \(see a table overview of the types [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/configure-pipeline-template?version=Cloud), or read more about [The Add-On Product](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#add-on-product-version)\), when they were created, as well as their delivery status:

    -   **Not ready**: The product version is currently being built and is not available for test or production use yet.

    -   **Ready for test**: The product version has been build but has not yet been released for production use. However, the version may be used for \(automated\) testing.

    -   **Ready for production**: The product version is ready for production use. An ABAP environment production system can now be updated to this product version.


3.  To create a new product version, click the *Create* button, choose *Delivery* or *Test* and select the desired type. The resulting product version will be calculated automatically.

    > ### Note:  
    > Note that if you begin configuring a new product version but cancel before finishing the process, the new product version will still be displayed in the overview list in status “not yet triggered”. To continue working on it, simply select it from the list.

4.  Select software components to be included in your new product version. To add additional software components, click the *Add* button on the right. For each software component, define a component version, enter the desired branch and commit ID as seen in the *Manage Software Components* app, and select in which languages your product version should be built.

    > ### Note:  
    > Note that the software components you use for the product version build have to be SAP-managed. [Bring Your Own Git \(BYOG\)](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/how-to-configure-your-git-repository?locale=en-US&version=Cloud) software components are currently not supported in the *Build Product Version* app.

    You can change the order of how the software components are imported via drag and drop in the table or by selecting a component and moving it using the arrows on the right.

    > ### Remember:  
    > The reuse software component should be the first, whereas a leading software component would be the last in order. This is to make sure that the software components are imported in the correct order, making sure to adhere to dependencies. The leading software component is the software component that is, as opposed to a reuse software component, exclusively used as part of one add-on product.

5.  Click the *Build Product Version* button to trigger the build of the pipeline for your new product version.

6.  \(Optional\): You can use the *Cancel* button on the lower right to leave the screen. Please be aware that after confirming the cancellation, all changes will be lost.

7.  You will be redirected to the Pipeline Status screen, where you can track the progress of your build. See [View Details on a Product Version’s Pipeline Progress](view-details-on-a-product-version-s-pipeline-progress-7713509.md).


> ### Note:  
> Product versions can only be deleted if their status is ‘*In Configuration*’ because then the build was not yet started. In this case, the delete button will be enabled once the product version is selected. Please be aware that the deletion cannot be reversed.

> The column Log Availability can have the following status:
