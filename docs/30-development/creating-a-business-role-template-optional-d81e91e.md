# Creating a Business Role Template \(Optional\)

In addition to a business catalog, you can also create a business role template with ABAP Development Tools \(ADT\). Creating a business role template is optional, but it can ease the business role creation for the administrator.



## Context

Creating a business role template especially makes sense if you have more than one business catalog to assign to a business role.



## Procedure

1.  Create a business role template as described in [Creating a Business Role Template](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/creating-business-role-template?locale=en-US).

2.  After the business role template has been created, add the business catalog to it.

3.  Choose *Publish Locally* to make the business role template available for use in the development system.
