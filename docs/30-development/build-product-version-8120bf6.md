# Build Product Version

You can use the *Build Product Version* app to easily trigger the build of new product versions via pipelines based on templates that you can configure for different use cases such as new \(test\) release deliveries, \(test\) support packages or \(test\) hotfixes/patch deliveries.

The app guides you through the creation of runs for your product versions and provisions an integration test system.

Since technical users are needed in various steps, the app can also be used to add and maintain credentials that can be reused in multiple products, see [Maintain Credentials](maintain-credentials-67b5aee.md).

Previously, the scenario was described in project "Piper", see [Build and Publish Add-On Products on SAP BTP, ABAP Environment.](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/) We recommend using the *Build Product Version* app that enables the 'Build Add-On Products' scenario for you without the need to set up a Jenkins server.
