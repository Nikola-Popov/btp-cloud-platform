## Solution

To fix your SAP SuccessFactors OData destination, you can try the following:

-   Make sure that the names of the destination properties, and their values match the names described in [Create an HTTP Destination in SAP BTP](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/55e837080eac424e8e107e18c3a8ac12.html#create-an-http-destination-for-consuming-the-sap-successfactors-hxm-suite-odata-apis).
-   Make sure that the values of the *Client Key* and *apiKey* properties match the *API Key* value specified in the SAP SuccessFactors OAuth client.
-   Make sure that the X509 certificate specified in the SAP SuccessFactors OAuth client is the same as the one you have in the Cloud Foundry environment. See [Configuring the Extension Application's Connectivity to SAP SuccessFactors](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/55e837080eac424e8e107e18c3a8ac12.html#).
-   Make sure that you have the *uaa.user* authorization scope defined in the *xs-security.json*file. See:
    -   [Update a Service Instance](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/7f926eb79a7746fd996363118cd2c2aa.html?q=xs-security.json)
    -   [UAA Scopes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/uaa.html#uaa-scopes)

-   Make sure that the *uaa.user* authorization scope is defined in the role template in the *xs-security.json*file. See [Accessing Business Service Data](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/783809d7e52f4e14a45945f3f2bad751.html).
-   Make sure you consume the destination correctly, as described in [Consum–µ the Destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/55e837080eac424e8e107e18c3a8ac12.html#loio528d9ae5e6e4495cbd65514294f3994a).
-   Make sure that you use the *user\_token* OAuth grant for retrieving the destination. See [OAuth User Token Exchange Authentication](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/e3c333f9de6245fca326993f2397c13a.html).
-   Make sure that the name of the destination that you use in your application matches the name of the one created in the SAP BTP cockpit.
-   Note that if you have a destination defined as an environment variable, it will overrule the one created in the cockpit.
-   Check the logs in Kibana. If you do not have the application logging service, you can add it. See [Access and Analyze Application Logs and Container Metrics](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ee8e8a203e024bbb8c8c2d03fce527dc/Cloud/en-US/30f9cfee0b5d46548ea2fca4ff75bb18.html).
-   Make sure that the name of the destination is the same as the name of the SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service instance you have created. See [Access and Analyze Application Logs, Container Metrics and Custom Metrics](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/8b774e4ca8be46a4830a021f727667ed.html?version=Cloud).
