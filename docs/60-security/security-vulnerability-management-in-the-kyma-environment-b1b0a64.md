# Security Vulnerability Management in the Kyma Environment

SAP employs a vulnerability management process to ensure the security of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. Within this process, we identify, assess, prioritize, remedy, and monitor vulnerabilities. We also provide hotfixes between regular releases for critical vulnerabilities that our security organization identifies.

SAP regularly scans SAP-owned code and the container images that are part of SAP BTP, Kyma runtime, Kyma Control Plane, and Kyma dashboard for known and potential vulnerabilities. The following security scanning technologies are used:

-   Static application security testing \(SAST\) for the proprietary code
-   Open source vulnerability management \(OSVM\) for open-source software that is part of Kyma runtime

> ### Note:  
> SAP runs security scans for Kyma runtime, and you, as a customer, are responsible for scanning your own workloads added to the Kyma cluster. For details, see [Operating Model in the Kyma Environment.](../70-getting-support/operating-model-in-the-kyma-environment-862b96b.md)

The scanning results are constantly monitored and addressed. Vulnerabilities are handled with software updates. If an update is not available, the vulnerability is subject to further analysis to identify its associated risk and implement appropriate measures. For critical vulnerabilities identified by SAP's security organization, hotfixes are applied between regular releases.

> ### Remember:  
> Kyma development teams analyze each vulnerability to assess its actual severity in the Kyma environment. Therefore, the severity score may be lowered or identified as false positive.
