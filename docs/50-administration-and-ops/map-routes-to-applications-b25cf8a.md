# Map Routes to Applications

Once a route has been created, you must map it to an application to make this application reachable for end users.

## Prerequisites

-   You have at least one route and one deployed application in the same Cloud Foundry space.

-   You must have the Space Developer or the Space Supporter role.




## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the *Routes* page in your Cloud Foundry space in the cockpit.

2.  For the route that you wish to map to an application, choose :link: from the *Actions* column and select the application you want to map it to.

## Results

Your application can now be accessed via the route mapped to it. You can launch your mapped route from two different places in the cockpit:

-   *Routes* page:

    Choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5">ÓÅö</span> \(Launch Route\) from the *Actions* column.

-   *Overview* page of the mapped application:

    Choose the URL from the *Application Routes* section.
