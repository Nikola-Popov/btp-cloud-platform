## Supported with Restrictions When Using Custom Identity Providers for Platform Users

Maximum number of parallel sessions per user per identity provider

</td>
<td valign="top">

Each user is allowed a maximum of 10 parallel sessions, per identity provider. This number considers all tools, including the cockpit and CLIs.

> ### Note:  
> When accessing the cockpit, a user is allowed one session in each region. For example, if you access [https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap](https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap), it counts as the first session and [https://amer.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap](https://amer.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap) as the second one.

Single logout \(SLO\)

</td>
<td valign="top">

For platform users of custom identity providers, logging out from the SAP BTP cockpit \(including Neo cockpit\) terminates the session in the used SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant and sessions of other applications that connect to the same tenant. What is required is that the sessions support this kind of logout. This requirement doesn't apply for other instances of the SAP BTP cockpit except for instances where the user initially logged out from. In this case, sessions remain active.

Working with custom domains for an SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant

</td>
<td valign="top">

SAP BTP always uses the default domain of the SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant, regardless of a potentially configured custom domain. Therefore, when you use this tenant as a platform identity provider:

-   Single sign-on \(SSO\) doesn't work between applications that use this custom domain and cloud management tools. Exception: if you use the same SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant for both platform and business users, as custom domain is a tenant setting.

-   The OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) issuer in the *Name* field of the SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant must be the default domain \(<origin\>.accounts.ondemand.com\).

    For more information, see [Tenant OpenID Connect Configurations](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/3d6abcc02ec945ad9615773e05814003.html?version=Cloud&q=UserInfo%20endpoint).

> ### Caution:  
> Don't change the *Name* field after configuring trust. Changing the issuer breaks the trust between the systems.
