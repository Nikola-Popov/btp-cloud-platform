# SAP Cloud Identity Services with Corporate Identity Provider

You want to insert your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant in the user authentication flow between your SAP BTP subaccount and your corporate identity provider. So far, you've migrated the trust configuration from your subaccount to use SAP Cloud Identity Services. Now, you configure SAP Cloud Identity Services to delegate user authentication to the corporate identity provider.

We already asked you to configure trust between your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant and your corporate identity provider is this step: [Prepare for Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect](prepare-for-migration-from-saml-trust-to-openid-connect-269f60d.md).

How you configure the connection depends on whether you're using identity federation or not. Identity federation is a configuration of SAP Cloud Identity Services. If you haven't connected SAP Cloud Identity Services to the corporate identity provider yet, use the disabled approach. If your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant already trusts your corporate provider, then choose the approach that fits to the existing trust configuration.

For more information about identity federation, see [Configure Identity Federation](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/c029bbbaefbf4350af15115396ba14e2.html) in the documentation of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

-   Identity federation is disabled \(default option\)

    See [Choose Default Identity Provider for an Application](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/e9d82742d42b4f769c2d0f16d8e9ee41.html) in the documentation of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

-   Identity federation is enabled \(advanced\)

    See [Configure Conditional Authentication for an Application](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/0143dce88a604533ab5ab17e639fec09.html)in the documentation of SAP Cloud Identity Services.




## Identity Federation Is Disabled

As you were preparing for this migration, you saw what subject and attributes you need for your users.

For more information, see [Prepare for Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect](prepare-for-migration-from-saml-trust-to-openid-connect-269f60d.md).

Attributes are passed to SAP BTP just as they're received from the corporate identity provider. Subject and attribute configurations on the SAP Cloud Identity Services application are ignored. The subject **must** be provided by the corporate identity provider as required. Attributes **ideally** come from the corporate identity provider with the attribute names used by the subaccount so far.

Compare the attributes you got before the migration to the attributes you get now.

For more information, see [Test the Trust Configuration After the Migration](test-the-trust-configuration-after-the-migration-edc7c42.md).

If the assertion attributes don't come from the corporate identity provider as you expected, change the names of the following assertion attributes as listed in the following table.


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

From User Attribute

</th>
<th valign="top">

To User Attribute

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

first\_name

</td>
<td valign="top">

given\_name

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

last\_name

</td>
<td valign="top">

family\_name

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

mail

</td>
<td valign="top">

email

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Map the attribute names between what the corporate identity provider provides and what the subaccount expects, according to the protocol of the trust configuration:

-   For OIDC: See [Enrich Token Claims Coming from Corporate IdP](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/f19e580088e74aaa96087f1def8972cd.html) in the documentation of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

-   For SAML: [Enrich Assertion Attributes Coming from Corporate IdP](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/7124201682434efb946e1046fde06afe.html) in the documentation of SAP Cloud Identity Services.
