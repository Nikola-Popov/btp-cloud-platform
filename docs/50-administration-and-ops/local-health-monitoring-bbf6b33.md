# Local Health Monitoring

With the *Health Monitoring* app, you can check the health of your local ABAP system.



<a name="loiobbf6b336bcb84d4185429dd76dfdfaf8__section_wqy_sp5_r5b"/>

## Context

This app allows you to monitor your system health **locally** directly on your ABAP system.

You get an overview of the metrics for the monitored system on one overview page. The health metrics are represented on individual cards with a KPI that summarizes the current status and with a history of the metrics to, for example, compare trends, identify performance bottlenecks, or investigate resource shortages.â€¯

The *Health Monitoring* app offers the following features:

-   The time filter settings apply globally to all cards on the screen, that is, to all KPIs and charts.

-   All charts are displayed on one screen and you can easily compare metrics over time.

-   Multiple characteristics are visible in one chart if applicable.

-   From some cards, you can navigate to related apps for further analysis or issue fixing. For more information, see the in-app help for the individual cards.


> ### Note:  
> If you want to monitor the health of multiple systems **centrally**, you can use SAP Cloud ALM. For more information, see [Central Health Monitoring Using SAP Focused Run and SAP Cloud ALM](central-health-monitoring-using-sap-focused-run-and-sap-cloud-alm-8d6e2e7.md).

*ABAP Compute Units*

</td>
<td valign="top">

`abap_acu_used_count_5m`

</td>
<td valign="top">

Used quota for ABAP system resources and resources that were allocated during the last 5 minutes

A quota represents the available system size and therefore the maximum allowed consumption of a resource. Each resource \(memory or CPU\) is measured against the quota independently. For ABAP system resources, the quota is measured in ABAP compute units \(ACUs\).

The allocation of ABAP system resources \(memory and CPU\) is also measured in ABAP compute units \(ACUs\). In a static service plan, the allocation corresponds to the quota limit of the service plan. In an elastic service plan, the allocation of resources is handled in an adaptive way.

The number of ACUs on this card refers to the resource \(memory or CPU\) with the highest quota usage.

-   Running application jobs: `abap_system_appl_jobs_running_count`

-   Successful application jobs: `abap_system_appl_jobs_success_count_5m`




</td>
<td valign="top">

The number of application jobs, which includes the following:

-   The number of delayed application jobs during the last 5 minutes.

    An application job is counted as delayed when its delay exceeds a certain threshold. The default configuration uses a threshold of 60 seconds.

-   The number of failed application jobs during the last 5 minutes

-   The number of currently running application jobs

-   The number of successfully finished application jobs during the last 5 minutes


The KPI on this card refers to the number of recently failed application jobs. You can compare this value with the successfully finished application jobs to get an overview of your overall application job health.

The number of ABAP statistics records that were captured by the *Capture Request Statistics* app during the last 5 minutes

In the *Capture Request Statistics* app, you can select the checkbox *Health Monitoring* for any capture profile that you create. The KPI on this card is the total number of captured ABAP statistics records during the last 5 minutes for profiles with the checkbox *Health Monitoring* selected.

Fill ratio of number range intervals

Only critical number range intervals are shown. When you create a number range interval, you can define the critical remaining fill ratio when a warning is generated.

If a critical number range was reported and is extended, it's reported once again with its now uncritical, good fill ratio to report the fixed state. After that, this number range is dropped from reported number range intervals because it's not critical anymore.

If the client certificate expires within 7 days, it's marked red. If it expires within 30 days, it's marked yellow.
