## Add Members to Your Global Account \[Feature Set A\]

Add users as global account members using the SAP BTP cockpit.



<a name="AddMembers-FSA__context_qpw_tkf_knb"/>

## Context

The users you add as members at global account level are automatically assigned the Administrator role.

All global account administrators can do the following:

-   View all the subaccounts in the global account, meaning all the subaccount tiles in the global account's *Subaccounts* page.
-   Edit general properties of the subaccounts in the global account from the *Edit* icon in the subaccount tile.
-   Create a new subaccount in the global account.
-   View, add, and remove global account members.
-   Manage entitlements for the global account.

On the *Members* page at the global account level in the cockpit, all global account members can view the global account administrators. If you're a subaccount member, you're also a member of the global account.



<a name="AddMembers-FSA__steps_spw_tkf_knb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Choose the global account to which you'd like to add members.

2.  In the navigation area, choose *Members*.

3.  Choose *Add Members*.

4.  Enter up to 100 user IDs. To separate them, you can use commas, spaces, semicolons, or line breaks.

5.  Choose *Add Members*.

## Next Steps

To delete members at global account level, choose :wastebasket: next to the user's ID.

<!-- AddMembers-FSB -->

## Add Members to Your Global Account \[Feature Set B\]

Add members to your global account by assigning them a role collection.



<a name="AddMembers-FSB__prereq_sf4_3hg_klb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You must be a global account administrator to add other global account members.

-   The users exist in a trusted platform identity provider.

    All users of SAP BTP are stored in identity providers, either in the default or in a custom identity provider. SAP BTP needs a copy of the user, sometimes called a shadow user. You assign the shadow user authorizations to access resources in SAP BTP. When a user authenticates, SAP BTP forwards the request to the identity provider.

    For more information, see [Trust and Federation with Identity Providers](trust-and-federation-with-identity-providers-cb1bc8f.md).




<a name="AddMembers-FSB__context_gr5_5kf_knb"/>

## Context

Assign predefined or custom role collections to users who need to manage or view the global account in SAP BTP cockpit. Examples of predefined role collections include the following:

-   *Global Account Administrator*

-   *Global Account Viewer*


For more information about these role collections, see [Role Collections and Roles in Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts](../10-concepts/role-collections-and-roles-in-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts-0039cf0.md).



<a name="AddMembers-FSB__steps_vqz_cjg_klb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your global account.

2.  Add a user to your global account.

    For more information, see [Create Users](create-users-a3bc7e8.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > If the user is already a user in a subaccount and has logged on to SAP BTP cockpit, SAP BTP adds the user at the global account level automatically, but without any role collections.

3.  Assign a role collection to the user.

    For more information, see [Assign Users to Role Collections](assign-users-to-role-collections-c576676.md).




<a name="AddMembers-FSB__result_syg_v3g_klb"/>

## Results

The next time this user logs on to the SAP BTP cockpit, the user can access this global account.
