# Manage Users in Directories

Manage members in your directory using the SAP BTP cockpit.



<a name="loioff4d4a4caff94b0486b6427eaa8a0b91__prereq_egz_33d_cqb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You're a directory administrator.

-   User management is enabled for this directory.

    If the feature isn't enabled already, you can do so using one of the following methods:

    -   Go to the *Account Explorer* page, edit the directory, and then under *Advanced*, choose the *Enable User Management* option.

    -   Navigate into the directory from the *Account Explorer* page, and then in the *Users* page, choose the *Enable Entitlement and User Management* option \(if entitlement management is already enabled for the directory, then choose the *Enable User Management* option instead\).

    > ### Note:  
    > -   The user management feature can be enabled only in combination with the entitlement management feature on the same directory in given path.
    > 
    > -   Only a single directory in any given directory path can have the user management and/or entitlement management features enabled. See [Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Directories](configure-entitlements-and-quotas-for-directories-37f8871.md).
    > 
    >     For example, if you have 3 stacked directories in your account hierarchy and the middle directory has both the user and entitlement management features enabled, then neither of these features can be enabled for its parent or child directory since these two directories are in the same direct path as the middle directory.

-   Your platform user exists in a trusted identity provider.

    All users of SAP BTP are stored in identity providers, either in the default or in a custom identity provider. SAP BTP needs a copy of the user, sometimes called a shadow user. You assign the shadow user authorizations to access resources in SAP BTP. When a user authenticates, SAP BTP forwards the request to the identity provider.

    For more information, see [Trust and Federation with Identity Providers](trust-and-federation-with-identity-providers-cb1bc8f.md).

## Context

Assign predefined or custom role collections to users who need to manage or view the directory in SAP BTP cockpit. Examples of predefined role collections include the following:

For more information about these role collections, see [Role Collections and Roles in Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts](../10-concepts/role-collections-and-roles-in-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts-0039cf0.md).



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your directory.

2.  Add a user to your directory.

    For more information, see [Create Users](create-users-a3bc7e8.md).

3.  Assign a role collection to the user.

    For more information, see [Assign Users to Role Collections](assign-users-to-role-collections-c576676.md).

In a user's overview, you can create and delete users, and assign role collections. You can also display an overview of the role collections, where you can drill down all the way to the role, and see the application that the role is belongs to.")
