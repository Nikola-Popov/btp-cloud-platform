# Delete Users

As an administrator, you can delete users from your subaccount. When you delete a user, you also delete the user's role collection assignments.

## Prerequisites

You have the required authorizations.

For more information, see [Security Administration: Managing Authentication and Authorization](security-administration-managing-authentication-and-authorization-1ff47b2.md) or [Role Collections and Roles in Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts](../10-concepts/role-collections-and-roles-in-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts-0039cf0.md).

## Context

All users in the subaccounts of SAP BTP are shadow users. As an administrator, you might want to clean up users from your subaccount. Or for data protection and privacy reasons, it might be a legal obligation that administrators delete shadow users who belonged to employees who left the company. For more information, see [Working with Users](working-with-users-2c91f88.md).

It's also possible to delete users using APIs. For more information, see the related links.

Keep in mind that you also delete the user's role collection assignments.

> ### Remember:  
> When you delete a user at the Cloud Foundry level, SAP BTP doesn’t delete the corresponding shadow user at the subaccount level.
> 
> When you delete a user at the subaccount level, ensure that you delete the user at the Cloud Foundry level too. Otherwise, if the Cloud Foundry user logs on again, the system automatically creates the corresponding user at the subaccount level.
> 
> So ensure that you delete the shadow users on all levels.

> ### Caution:  
> You cannot undo the deletion of a user.
