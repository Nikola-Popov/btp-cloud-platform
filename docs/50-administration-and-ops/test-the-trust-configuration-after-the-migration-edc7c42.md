# Test the Trust Configuration After the Migration

Check that your users can still access their applications and have all the attributes they require. Use these steps to validate your new configuration.



<a name="loioedc7c42084d64861beeeba9c30a7525d__prereq_ujt_dhn_hxb"/>

## Prerequisites

You saved the list of attributes you get before the migration.

For more information, see [Prepare for Migration from SAML Trust to OpenID Connect](prepare-for-migration-from-saml-trust-to-openid-connect-269f60d.md).

## Procedure

1.  Check what attributes your user has now.

    <code>https://<i class="varname">&lt;subaccount_subdomain&gt;</i>.authentication.<i class="varname">&lt;region&gt;</i>.hana.ondemand.com/config?action=who&amp;details=true&amp;trustMigrationOnly=true</code>

    For example

    `https://my-subdomain.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/config?action=who&details=true&trustMigrationOnly=true`

2.  Compare with the results you had before the migration.

    In the following example, the user has a few special attributes in addition to the standard ones:

    -   Custom attribute `cost_center`

    -   Group assignment `my-group`

    -   Authorization assignment over the group to the role collection for reading audit logs

    > ### Note:  
    > In the new OIDC application, uppercase or lower case G in the `groups` attribute name doesn't matter.

3.  If there are any remaining differences, adjust the configuration of the SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant or applications or of the corporate identity provider until you get the same attributes.

    For more information, see [Configuration of SAP Cloud Identity Services After Migration from SAML to OIDC](configuration-of-sap-cloud-identity-services-after-migration-from-saml-to-oidc-1fa7273.md).

    Use the OIDC token logging in SAP Cloud Identity Services to help troubleshoot any problems.

    For more information, see [Logging OpenID Connect Tokens](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/b6c42b53518b46de8b4dffd8c4c52ed7.html) in the documentation of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

    If you can't get the configuration to work, restore the SAML trust configuration.

    For more information, see [Restore SAML Trust Configuration](restore-saml-trust-configuration-21d86cf.md).

## Next Steps

Once everything is working as you expected and are certain you don't need it anymore, delete your old SAML trust configuration with the origin ***oidc-migration-backup***.

> ### Caution:  
> If you delete the old SAML trust configuration too early, you can't use the restore feature anymore.

Restore your SAML configuration to get your applications working again.")
