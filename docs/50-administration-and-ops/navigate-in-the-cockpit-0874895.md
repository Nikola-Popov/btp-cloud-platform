## Navigate to Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts \[Feature Set B\]



<a name="Navigate-FSB__steps_ibv_bhf_mqb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to a global account.

    -   **You have only one global account:**

        When you log on to the cockpit you’re automatically taken into your global account, to the *Account Explorer* page.

    -   **You have multiple global accounts:**

        When you log on to the cockpit, a dialog opens up containing the list of all global accounts that you’re part of. In this dialog, select the global account you want to navigate to.

        > ### Tip:  
        > If you have one global account you usually navigate to, you can choose *Remember my selection* in the initial dialog. This means you’ll be automatically redirected to your preferred global account after logging on, without seeing the dialog with all the options each time.
        > 
        > If you've chosen a default global account, you can change or remove it anytime. To do so, navigate to the *Account Explorer* page of any global account, choose *Switch Global Account*.
        > 
        > To change it, choose the desired new default global account from the list, select *Save new selection as default global account* and choose *Continue*. Your new default is savedand you’re redirected to that global account.
        > 
        > To delete the default global account and go back to seeing the selection dialog after each logon, simply choose the <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> icon next to your default global account name in the dialog and choose *Close*.


    You can see which global account you are in at any time by looking at the first item in the breadcrumbs. It looks like this: :globe_with_meridians: *<global account name\>*

2.  Navigate to a different global account.

    -   Navigate to the *Account Explorer* page at global account level and choose *Switch Global Account*.

    -   Use the dropdown menu next to the :globe_with_meridians: *<global account name\>*.

3.  \(Optional\) Navigate to directories.

    1.  When you enter your global account, you are by default taken to the *Account Explorer* page of that global account. To navigate to a directory, choose the corresponding entry in one of the views in the *Directories & Subaccounts* tab.

        > ### Note:  
        > If a directory has the **user management** capability enabled, then you can access this directory \(or its subdirectories\) only if you are a global account admin or you are assigned as a member of the directory. See [Manage Users in Directories](manage-users-in-directories-ff4d4a4.md).
        > 
        > The :lock: icon is shown next to directories that you aren't authorized to access.


4.  Navigate to subaccounts.

    1.  When you enter your global account, you are by default taken to the *Account Explorer* page of that global account. To navigate to a subaccount, choose the corresponding entry from one of the views.

        Once you've entered a subaccount, the breadcrumbs look like this: :globe_with_meridians: *<global account name\> /* <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> *<subaccount name\>*

        > ### Note:  
        > To access a subaccount your user must either have authorizations in the subaccount tenant or, in the case of a subaccount that has the Cloud Foundry environment enabled, have authorizations in the Cloud Foundry org or space of the subaccount. See [About User Management in the Cloud Foundry Environment](about-user-management-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-8e6ce96.md).
        > 
        > The :lock: icon is shown next to subaccounts that you aren't authorized to access.
