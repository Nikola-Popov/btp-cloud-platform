## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account \(China \(Shanghai\) region\) orsubaccount. For more information, see [Navigate in the Cockpit](navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md).

3.  Choose your space in *Cloud Foundry* \> *Spaces* or, for subscriptions, see [Configure Application Roles and Assign Roles to Users](configure-application-roles-and-assign-roles-to-users-56a7153.md).

4.  Choose the application.

5.  Choose *Security* \> *Roles*.

6.  To create a new role, choose *Create*.

    A wizard guides you through the role creation process.

7.  Enter a name and a description of the new role.

8.  Select the role template that you want to use.

9.  Choose *Next*.

10. To specify an attribute, choose the source of the attribute. The following sources are available:

    **Attribute Sources**


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Source
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Value/Attribute
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Static* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Enter a static value, for example `USA` to refine the role depending on the country/region.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Identity Provider* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Enter an attribute as defined in your identity provider. Check in your identity provider for the exact syntax of the attribute identifier.

    For SAP Cloud Identity Services, you find the attribute identifier in the settings of the attributes under *Applications & Resources* \> *Applications* \> **<Application Name\>** \> *Trust* \> *Attributes*.

    > ### Example:  
    > To use the attribute for cost center, you must enter the value `cost_center`.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Unrestricted* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    In this case, you want to express that it isn't necessary to set a specific value for this attribute. The behavior is the same as if the attribute wouldn't exist for this role.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
11. Choose *Next*.

12. Select the role collections for your new role. For more information, see the related link.

13. Choose *Next* and *Finish*.

    You have now created a new role with attributes.
