# Maintain Business Roles



With this app you can access the maintenance UI for restrictions as well as the *Restrictions Overview*.

With the *Maintain Business Roles* app, you can also define business roles by combining predefined business catalogs. You use business roles to control the access to your applications. The predefined catalogs contain the actual authorizations that allow users to access apps and allow to define instance-based restrictions where necessary. Business catalogs bundle authorizations for a specific business area. Once you have created a business role, you can assign it to multiple business users who perform similar business tasks.



## Key Features

-   Display the *Restrictions Overview*
