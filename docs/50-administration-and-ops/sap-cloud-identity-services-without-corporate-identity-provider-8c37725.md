# SAP Cloud Identity Services Without Corporate Identity Provider

You've only changed the protocol of the trust configuration between your SAP Business Technology Platform subaccount and SAP Cloud Identity Services.

Copy the following configurations from the old SAML-based SAP Cloud Identity Services application to your new OIDC-based SAP Cloud Identity Services application:

-   Subject name identifier

    See [Configure the Subject Name Identifier Sent to the Application](http://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/1d020e3a3ba34c43a71fde70bfa6419a.html) in the documentation of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

-   Attributes

    Change the names of the following attributes as listed in the following table.


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    From User Attribute
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    To User Attribute
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    first\_name
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    given\_name
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    last\_name
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    family\_name
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    mail
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    email
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
