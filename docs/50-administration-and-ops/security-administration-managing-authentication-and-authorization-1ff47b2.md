# Security Administration: Managing Authentication and Authorization

This section describes the tasks of administrators of SAP BTP. Administrators ensure user authentication and assign authorization information to users and user groups.

Since identity providers provide the users or user groups, you make then sure that there is a trust relationship between your subaccount and the identity provider. This is a prerequisite for authentication. You can manage the authorizations of the business users.

## Authentication

Identity providers provide the business users. The default platform identity provider for SAP BTP is SAP ID service. If you use external identity providers, you must configure the trust relationship using the SAP BTP cockpit. The respective subaccount must have a trust relationship with the identity provider. Using the SAP BTP cockpit, you, as an administrator of the Cloud Foundry environment, establish this trust relationship.

## Authorization

In the Cloud Foundry environment, application developers create and deploy application-based authorization artifacts for business users. Administrators use this information to assign roles, build role collections, and assign these collections to business users or user groups. In this way, they control the users' permissions.

> ### Note:  
> When users log on, their authorizations are stored in each user's current browser session. These authorizations are not dynamically updated and are removed from there only if the session is terminated or invalidated. This means that if you assign a role collection to a user, only the authorizations that are in their current token, apply. The user must log out and log on again to get a new token.
