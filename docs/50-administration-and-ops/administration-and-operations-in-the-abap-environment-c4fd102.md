<a name="loioc4fd10279d6e44be8e65b6841acb52f6__section_fyr_2wx_5vb"/>

## Task Examples

As an administrator in the ABAP environment, you focus on administration and operational tasks that aren't managed by SAP. Such tasks can include, for example:

-   Account and organization management, including identity and access management for your users
-   Monitoring of performance issues and exceptions in your own applications

    Such a monitoring includes response times of application-related communication endpoints, SQL statements issued by the application, application jobs, or ABAP runtime errors originating from custom code.

-   System sizing, including a regular review of the overall resource utilization

    Such a system sizing can include a daily check of resource utilization peaks and a monthly check of resource utilization trends.

-   Software lifecycle of custom applications \(add-on updates or custom transports\)
-   Tenant management if you manage multi-tenant custom applications
-   Monitoring of integrations with other cloud or on-premise based services
