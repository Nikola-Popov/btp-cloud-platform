# Message Dashboard



With this app, you can get an overview of the interfaces you're responsible for and their current status. You can analyze the root causes of errors, restart or cancel data messages.



## Key Features

-   See all interfaces you've been assigned to using recipients.

-   See the general status of your interfaces over time and restrict the time range.

-   Check for active alerts and confirm them in the column *Alert*.

-   Configure what notifications you want to receive for a specific interface in the column *Notification*. You can choose between *E-Mail for the Next Alert* \(default\), *E-Mail for Every Single Error*, and *No Mail*.

-   See the message numbers and statuses \(error, warning, success\) by namespace and interface.

-   Navigate to the message summary for an overview of how often a certain log message was written to the application log and how many data messages used a certain log message.

-   Navigate to the monitoring and error handling to analyze the log messages in detail.

-   Display the contents of the data messages.

-   Create custom hints, message texts, and functions for certain log messages.
