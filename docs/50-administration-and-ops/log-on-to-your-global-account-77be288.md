## Prerequisites

You have received a welcome e-mail from SAP for your global account. If you don't have a global account administrator or one isn't available, there is a workaround using SAP for Me.

For more information, see [2669325 - How to add a user as a Global Account administrator for SAP Business Technology Platform](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002669325).

## Procedure

1.  Use the link in your Welcome e-mail.

    Choose `https://cockpit.btp.cloud.sap` to access the cockpit. Depending on your own geo location this URL will redirect you to the closest regional cockpit URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > If single sign-on has not been configured for you, you will have to enter your credentials. You’ll find your logon ID in your Welcome e-mail.

2.  Choose a global account.

## Next Steps

-   Track and monitor usage of services in your global account:

    -   Use the filters to specify which usage information to display in the tables and monthly usage charts. The *Period* filter is applied to the chart display.
    -   Some rounding or shortening is applied to large values. Mouse over values in the table to view the exact values in the tooltips.
    -   Choose a row in the table to view its historic information in the *Monthly Usage* chart. To display a larger view of a chart, choose the <span style="font-size:16px;"><span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span></span> \(Zoom\) button.
    -   To download the information in the *Overview* page to a Microsoft Excel file, choose the *Export* button.

-   Access your subaccounts and create new subaccounts.
