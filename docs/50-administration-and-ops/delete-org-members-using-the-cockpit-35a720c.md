## Prerequisites

-   You have the Org Manager role for the org in question.

    > ### Note:  
    > When you enable Cloud Foundry and the org is created, the Org Manager role is assigned automatically to you.

    For more information, see [About Roles in the Cloud Foundry Environment](about-roles-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-0907638.md).

-   The users exist in a trusted platform identity provider.

    For more information, see [About User Management in the Cloud Foundry Environment](about-user-management-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-8e6ce96.md).
