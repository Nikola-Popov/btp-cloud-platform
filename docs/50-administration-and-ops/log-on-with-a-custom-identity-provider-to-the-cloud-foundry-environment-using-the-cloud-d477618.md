## Prerequisites

-   You’ve created at least one subaccount and enabled the Cloud Foundry environment in this subaccount. For more information, see [Create a Subaccount](create-a-subaccount-05280a1.md).

-   You've downloaded and installed the Cloud Foundry command-line interface \(cf CLI\).

    For more information, see [Download and Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](download-and-install-the-cloud-foundry-command-line-interface-4ef907a.md).

-   Your administrator has configured your Cloud Foundry environment to use a custom identity provider.

    For more information, see [Establish Trust and Federation of Custom Identity Providers for Platform Users](establish-trust-and-federation-of-custom-identity-providers-for-platform-users-c368984.md).

-   You've configured the login screen to display your custom identity provider, see [Log on with a Browser to the Cloud Foundry CLI and Service Dashboards](log-on-with-a-browser-to-the-cloud-foundry-cli-and-service-dashboards-7eb0943.md) \(relevant for the manual login process\).

## Context

The cf CLI provides different options to log on using a custom identity provider. One scenario is recommended for an interactive logon because you must switch from the CLI to the browser to log on. This scenario supports multifactor authentication and other passwordless authentication methods, as well as single sign-on. The other scenario focuses on automation scenarios where switching between the CLI and a browser isn’t possible.
